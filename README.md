# Floating Farm - Website For Supply Entries 

The website tracks incoming deliveries of food scraps, and handles requests for this aquired data. It visualizes trends by comparing this data to milk production.

The project is a small full-stack CRUD, making use of:
- Node.js with Express.js
- Vue.js
- Azure
